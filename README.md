# CIS2C-Final-Project
A showcase of my ability to use everything I've learned this semester to create a useful application.

This is a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

Players will take turns, the application will keep track of the turns and the different win-states.
The scoreboard will save the data, and display even through a page refresh.
